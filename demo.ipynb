By minimizing\\\\nconsumption and waste, we ensure\\\\nthat we use only what is necessary.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Tech-Driven Waste Reduction\\\\n\\\\nWaste of resources from overproduction is a\\\\nsystemic challenge that the retail sector faces.\\\\nAcknowledging this problem, our innovative\\\\non-demand business model strives to minimize\\\\nwaste from the start, which also reduces costs for\\\\ncustomers. Utilizing small-batch ordering based on\\\\ntrend research and direct feedback, SHEIN seeks\\\\nto maintain consistently low unsold inventory rates.\\\\nAdditionally, our digital supplier management\\\\nsystem equips our partners with real-time insights,\\\\nto aid in more accurate production planning and\\\\nminimize resource wastage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Conserving Water\\\\n\\\\nWater is an essential resource at every stage of\\\\nthe apparel value chain, and we are committed\\\\nto optimizing its use within our supply chain.\\\\n\\\\nMany of our suppliers already use closed-loop\\\\nwater treatment and reuse processes that help\\\\nreduce water consumption. We also invest in\\\\nresearch and development of manufacturing\\\\n\\\\ntechnology and production processes that\\\\nconsume less water, and encourage our suppliers\\\\nto adopt these practices.\\\\n\\\\nOur CbD projects for supplier facilities,\\\\nimplemented in collaboration with Apparel Impact\\\\nInstitute, have also targeted improving water\\\\nefficiency. Our projects in 2023 are estimated to\\\\nhave saved around 1 million cubic meters of water.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2023, over 52% of directly sourced printed fabric\\\\nutilized digital thermal transfer printing (DTP),\\\\nwhich is a zero-water-waste printing method\\\\nverified by Bureau Veritas. The DTP initiative\\\\nis estimated to have saved over 290,000 cubic\\\\nmeters of water and over 32,600 MWh of electricity\\\\ncompared to traditional screen-printing in 2023,\\\\nwhich also results in a reduction of 60,524 metric\\\\ntons of CO2e.\\\\n\\\\nSHEIN is also working with suppliers to increase\\\\nadoption of cool transfer denim printing technology,\\\\nwhich uses innovative high-fixation ink in place of\\\\nconventional indigo colorants. This method was\\\\nverified by Bureau Veritas in October 2023 to use\\\\n70.5% less water than traditional denim apparel\\\\nwashing methods. This also provides our designers\\\\nwith more flexibility to create designs with a variety\\\\nof colors and style accents, since they can print the\\\\npattern onto the denim fabric directly using a digital\\\\nprinter. SHEIN has integrated the cool transfer\\\\ndenim production process into our agile supply\\\\nchain, allowing our suppliers to produce innovative\\\\ndenim designs in a more water-efficient manner.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# CLEAN BY DESIGN - SUPPORTING WATER CONSERVATION\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## SHEIN Supplier in Zhaoqing City\\\\n\\\\nThrough the CbD initiative, with the support\\\\nof SHEIN\\'s team of experts, a SHEIN\\\\nsupplier in Zhaoqing City enhanced their\\\\nmotor energy efficiency and switched to\\\\nenergy-efficient machinery like dyeing\\\\nmachines, shaping devices and air\\\\ncompressors. They also developed a system\\\\nto monitor and mitigate water and stream\\\\nrunoff and leaks and pioneered research\\\\ninto energy-conserving, short-duration\\\\ndyeing processes. This not only reduced\\\\ntheir energy footprint, but also resulted in a\\\\n19.7% reduction in water usage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## SHEIN Supplier in Foshan City\\\\n\\\\nWith SHEIN\\'s experts assessing and\\\\nevaluating production methods and\\\\nproviding technical support, our supplier\\\\nin Foshan City managed to achieve an\\\\n18.2% reduction in water usage and a\\\\n15.4% reduction in wastewater discharge\\\\nby revamping their production methods.\\\\nThe supplier implemented measures such\\\\nas dyeing machine insulation, centralized\\\\ncooling systems and self-service dye\\\\ntransfer systems, and adopted deep\\\\ntreatment and reuse of wastewater from\\\\ndyeing and finishing operations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"]}])', call_id='call_jZo2pYX4BAFqgSNxR0vcGbZs'), FunctionExecutionResult(content='dict_values([{\\'Chunks\\': [\\'SHEIN\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## INTRODUCTION\\\\n\\\\nPEOPLE: EQUITABLE\\\\nEMPOWERMENT\\\\n\\\\nEnable Self-Expression for All\\\\nProvide Access to Talent\\\\nImprove Lives in Communities\\\\n\\\\nPLANET\\\\nPROCESS\\\\nGOVERNANCE\\\\nANNEX\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# Empowering Communities We Reach\\\\n\\\\nAs SHEIN grows, we believe in\\\\nhelping our communities and\\\\necosystem partners grow with us.\\\\n\\\\nAt SHEIN, we understand our responsibility\\\\nto drive positive change.
