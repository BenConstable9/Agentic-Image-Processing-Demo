# Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Demo

This demo was written for an internal Microsoft Conference to demo how the Image Processing Accelerator (aka.ms/rag-imageprocessing) can be used in conjunction with the Retrieval Augmented Thoughts technique (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05313).

This is purely just demo code, do not use in production.

To run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`chainlit run demo.py`
